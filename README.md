# README

Source code of a lightning talk on web components I gave at Manas on Dec 19, 2018.

It shows how to build a vimeo-embed widget just with web standards (well, maybe except HTML Imports).

Most of the code is based on an example presented in https://auth0.com/blog/web-components-how-to-craft-your-own-custom-components/.

I just restructured it to fit a narrative of "I want a custom tag -> I code a custom element -> I style with shadow DOM -> I define the UI declaratively with HTML templates -> I vendor the whole thing using an HTML import".
